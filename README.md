# Overview

I have ported a mandelbrot sep program I made for javascript to python

I made this to work on learing python as a programing language. I also like the mandelbrot set so it was fun

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
